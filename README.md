# ENGLISH VERSION
# About this repository 
PADeCI is an interdisciplinary research team based in Aguascalientes, Mexico. Currently, one of it's main projects concerns the processing, analysis and creation of COVID-19 data for Mexico, necessary for evidence-based decision making amid the context of uncertainty. This repository concerns the first stage of data analysis: the cleaning process. The data that is generated at this stage is the primary source of information that is used in PADeCI's mathematical modeling,  projections and publications. Following the scientific principle of transparency, any person can replicate the cleaning process done by PADeCI's team using the contents of this repository. 

# Requirements 
R version 3.6.2 (this version is recommended to avoid potential bugs) 

# Usage 
Any user can either clone this repository in its own computer or download specific files in order to replicate PADeCI's job.

# Folders description
**1. Analysis:** It containts two R scripts which manage data wranglig at county level and state level (which includes nation wide information as well as Mexico City Metropolitan Area, or _MCMA_, data). 

**2. Automatization:** The automatization folder include several scripts that automate tasks such as downloading official data and comparing it with the data generated by the wranging scripts and even generating daily reports, among others.  

**3. Data raw:** This folder contains the source data that is used in all of PADECI's estimations and reports at the national level. Some of the files that are contained at the folder are the daily numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico, as well as population data disaggregated by county and age groups. 

**4. Data validation:** Data validation consist in keeping a daily register of both, data reported by Mexican authorities and PADECI's cleaned data.  

**5. Data:** The data folder contains all the cleaned data bases, which include: 
- County level data (issued weekly) 
- State level data (issued daily) 
  - It includes national data
  - It also includes MCMA data
